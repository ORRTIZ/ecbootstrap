# ecbootstrap
Bootstrap based theme component for ecommerce components in/for Apache OFBiz™ based and ORRTIZ™

## Development
Just put the following in the svn:externals properties of the hot-deploy folder of your OFBiz implementation for a checkout:

ecbootstrap         https://github.com/ORRTIZ/ecbootstrap/trunk

After having updated the hot-deploy folder (to execute the checkout from the repository), you'll need to build OFBiz again (./ant build) and load the seed, seed-initial and  - optionally- demo datasets.

## Implementation
